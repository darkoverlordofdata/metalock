metalock - enhanced X11 screen locker
=================================
A simple, yet flexible screen locker utility for X.

Features
--------

  - Support for pixmap (image) xpm background and login box.

  - It gives visual feedback as you type the password (Shows username and * for
  each character of password typed.)

  - Bind arbitrary commands to key combinations (allows tasks such as
  pause/un-pause music without unlocking the screen)

  - Optional XFT support for anti-aliased fonts.  (This is optional in case
  greater security is desired)

  - Optional Imlib2 support for use of png or jpg formats, which are more
  appropriate for photos or high-color images than xpm.

  - Portable to most UNIX-like operating systems, developed on FreeBSD.

Requirements
------------

In order to build metalock you need the following:

Compile time dependencies:

  - A C compiler.  Both clang and gcc have been tested.

  - BSD Make.  Both the portable NetBSD make and FreeBSD make should work.
  Unfortunately, GNU make does not work.  If you are using Linux, please see
  "Installation" for some workarounds.

Run time dependencies:

  - X11 library and header files.  (specifically Xlib, xpm)

  - Xft library is optional, but recommended.  You can omit it if you want
  metalock to be more secure, or if you prefer the appearance of the old style
  fonts.  For most people, Xft is suggested.

  - ultragetopt library is optional, but recommended.  (If ultragetopt is not
  used, then you must have a system getopt installed)

  - Imlib2 is optional.  It generally offers better performance over native
  libxpm loading code, especially for large, high color images or photos.

    Png or jpg files, and hence Imlib2, should be preferred if your image
  has a lot of colors, since it will load orders of magnitude faster than an
  xpm file.

    However, recent improvements in the order of xpm loading substantially
  improved performance over the old code, such that Imlib2 is no longer
  necessary if your image does not have a lot of colors.

    Since it is a very large library compared to Xpm, it is more likely to
  contain potential security problems than any of the Xlib libraries, which are
  small in comparison.

Installation
------------

1) Determine if you have the proper libraries installed.

2) Either edit config.mk to match your local setup, or define the variables
explicitly on the make invocation.

If you are using Linux, you have two options as far as make is concerned:

  a) Use NetBSD make "bmake", which has a package for most Linux distributions.

  b) Otherwise, if you want to use GNU make, you need to comment out the line
  that includes the theme metadata.mk, and explicitly define the variables in
  that file as the arguments to GNU make.

    Most likely, there will be some other incompatibilities in the Makefile.
  (such as the conditional statements).  Although b) is not officially
  supported, most differences should be easy to patch.

Set the PREFIX variable to the namespace of your operating system.  On most
BSDs that is /usr/local (the default in config.mk), and on Linux, you should
set it to /usr.

Set the variable CC to either clang (default) or gcc.

3) Make sure that the themes path exists, and contains the default theme.

If you are not building from the fossil repository, then you will need to add a
theme to the themes directory, as follows:

  1) Download desired theme tarball

  2) Copy theme tarball file to themes/

  3) Extract theme tarball

  4) Delete theme tarball

4) Enter the following command to build and install metalock (typically as
root):

# cd src/

# make clean install

Running metalock
----------------

Simply invoke the 'metalock' command. To get out of it, enter your password.

If you want help regarding the different command-line options, type:

> metalock -h

OR

> metalock --help

To get information about your version of metalock, type:

> metalock -V -v 2
